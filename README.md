This is based off of https://github.com/s0md3v/Zen. 

1. Get all the usernames from this GitHub page (and the rest, see the table of contents on the bottom): https://github.com/search?o=desc&p=1&q=followers%3A%3E%3D312&s=followers&type=Users. 

2. Put all the usernames into a file (usernames_output.txt).

3. Feed the usernames into the modified Zen code.
